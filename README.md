# Covid-19-Analysis
My work team and I did a simulation analysis of Covid 19 in Italy from 2020 to the present to see if it makes sense for a large pharmaceutical company (our possible client) to develop a vaccine against Covid.

My work team and I imagined that we were hired by a large pharmaceutical company and that it had given us the following directions:

The request for analysis comes from the pharmaceutical company XYFARMA Il client), which has to decide whether to develop a new anticovid vaccine.
The client is requesting to obtain a focused analysis to view COVID data from 2020 to the present (the latest year available), so that strategic decisions can be made for the company regarding the development of a new vaccine. 
Your job will be to produce a report Tabelle Pivot, Pivot Charts and Masks) to be presented to XYFARMA, which requests to delve into the trend of infected, cured, deceased, vaccinated in Italy by focusing the analysis on the ratio of Infected/Vaccinated precisely to decide whether it is worth investing in the development of a new vaccine.

Write a final report to submit to XYFARMA describing the situation and suggesting to the client the best solution (to create or not to create a new vaccine) based on the data collected and analyzed.  Describe why the chosen solutions were chosen throughout the work.
